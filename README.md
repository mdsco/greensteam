Please view the administrative menu (the link is located at the bottom of the main page).  Use 'admin' for 
user and password.  Although this is still a work in progress, please notice the functionality of the admin 
tools.  They are designed to be intuitive and to automatically guide the user via through adding new users, etc,
by dynamically revealing appropriate inputs upon user selection and only allowing input when needed.
